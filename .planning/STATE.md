## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure derived from requirements -- core fix, UI, packaging
- [Roadmap]: PKG-01 (TOC file) assigned to Phase 1 since addon cannot load without it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: PlayMusic() suppression durability across subzone transitions is unverified
- [Research]: Interface version 20505 vs 20504 needs live client confirmation
