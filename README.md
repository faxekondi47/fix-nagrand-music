# FixNagrandMusic

You know that annoying Orgrimmar drum music that plays when you're wandering around Nagrand in TBC Classic Anniversary? Yeah, that's a bug. The game plays the wrong zone music, and there's no client-side fix for it.

This addon detects when you're in Nagrand and plays the correct original TBC zone music, complete with day/night track variants. It fades out the bugged drums automatically -- no manual intervention needed.
